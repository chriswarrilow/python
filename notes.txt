name = number or name | will create a variable to store assigned name or number
to the variable.

variable names will need '' and numbers don't.

using print(f"text here") will allow you to put variables inside the string.
example: print(f"there are {cars} parked here") where {cars} would be a number
variable.

you could also use the .format to insert variables inside strings.

\n will create a new line.

""" will allow you
to type like this And
it will still work"""

input() will ask a user to type something.
age = input()  would ask the user for his/her age and then assign the number
input by the user and the age variable.

inputs can also be done like this:
age = input("How old are you? ") but it will always assign the number to the
first word as a variable.
